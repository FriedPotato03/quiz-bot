# Quiz Bot 

__My first GitHub project:__ A Quiz Bot for MASK using discord.py.

## Purpose:
The idea to make this bot came when we had our first MASK quiz. It is expected that none of us knew _that_ many animes and we were forced to rely on herd mentality. Because of this one reason, the purpose of the quiz was somewhat nullified. In order to make the responses anonymous, this bot will be using the DMs to send questions and receive responses rather than using a channel common to all participants.

## How will it work?:
The bot will launch a quiz with the command `<>start {quiz_number}`.
It will send a message saying that a quiz will be launched, and asks the participants to react to it with [ðŸ‡¾] in order to participate. 

Once they have registered, questions will be sent to each participant one-by-one with enough time (say 15 seconds) to react to it. Their reaction will be taken, stored and used to calculate the results.  

The bot will recognize its messages with a distinct message keyphrase. 

For the quiz beginning, the keyphrase is
> **Starting Quiz ID** 
>
For each question of the quiz, the keyphrase is
> **Quiz ID:**
