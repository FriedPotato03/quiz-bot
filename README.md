# Quiz Bot 

__My first GitHub project:__ A Quiz Bot for MASK using discord.py.

## Purpose:
The idea to make this bot came when we had our first MASK quiz. It is expected that none of us knew _that_ many animes and we were forced to rely on herd mentality. Because of this one reason, the purpose of the quiz was somewhat nullified. In order to make the responses anonymous, this bot will be using the DMs to send questions and receive responses rather than using a channel common to all participants.

## How will it work?:
The bot will check for reaction addition/removal in its messages, and then check if the message it was reacted to is related to the quiz or not. If it is related to the quiz, then the necessary function (which is still under wraps) will be run.

More details will be updated soon ig. 
Until then, honk.
