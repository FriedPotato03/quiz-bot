This folder will have the following files:
- owner.txt (This will have the Discord user ID of the owner. It is an integral value)
- token.txt (This will have the token of the Discord bot. Be careful to check that this file is mentioned in .gitignore)
- roles.json (This will have the moderation roles in it. )

For the first instance of using the bot code, the owner and token files need to have some data. The roles file can just be an empty file if needed.
